## 1.Subscription service for `VIP`.

### Payment: 
The user confirms the purchase and the payment is credited to the iTunes account.
### Unsubscribe: 
To un renew, please turn off auto-renewal in `iTunes/AppleID` settings 24 hours before the current subscription cycle expires, and cancellations within 24 hours of expiration will be charged.
### Renewal: 
Apple's iTunes account will be charged 24 hours before expiration, and the subscription cycle will be extended by one subscription period after the charge is successful.
